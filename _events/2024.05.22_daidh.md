The challenges related to inclusion and accessibility of digital resources have become particularly relevant with technological development and the emergence of an increasingly pervasive digital paradigm in the cultural sphere. The promotion of diversity, inclusion, and accessibility has become increasingly important in international policies, including in the publishing sphere (European Accessibility Act), and today the need to promote participation and equity in the production and dissemination of knowledge is one of the key aspects: issues such as overcoming the digital divide and accessibility to information are the objectives of national and international agendas and guidelines, such as those provided by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). 

Despite the significant activism in research and the presence of important networks and reference organizations (such as the Daisy Consortium, Accessible Books Consortium, LIA, and EDRLab), the debate has not yet widely involved producers of specialized resources and tools, such as Digital Scientific Editions (DSE), or collections of GLAM institutions responsible for preserving and disseminating cultural heritage. The University of Verona's Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures is organising a conference from 22 to 24 May 2024 to facilitate debate and discussion on the issues at hand. The conference aims to draw attention to experiences, good practices, critical issues, and new perspectives, as well as potential solutions that can help overcome the digital divide and promote the accessibility of primary sources.

The conference is organised with the support of the Digital Arena for Inclusive Humanities (DAIH) centre.
