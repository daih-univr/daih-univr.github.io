The 14<sup>th</sup> Annual Conference of the [Association for Digital Humanities and Digital Culture (AIUCD)](https://aiucd.it) will take place in Verona in June 2025, organized by DAIH. The theme of the conference will be "**Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: Challenges and Opportunities for Digital Humanities in the Age of Artificial Intelligence**," providing a unique opportunity to address crucial issues at a time when the integration between technology and the humanities is becoming increasingly necessary. In a world where artificial intelligence is redefining the boundaries of knowledge, it is essential to explore how this transformation can be guided by principles of inclusivity and equity. The topics covered, such as Digital Humanities and Inclusion, not only highlight the importance of diverse representation in the humanities but also emphasize how digital and computational tools can be used to democratize access to knowledge and culture.
