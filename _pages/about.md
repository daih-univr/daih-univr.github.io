The Digital Arena for Inclusive Humanities (DAIH) is an interdisciplinary research center of excellence in the field of digital technologies and computational methods applied to languages and literature, with a focus on inclusion.

Established within the framework of the [University Departments of Excellence 2023-2027](https://www.anvur.it/en/activities/departments/) funding scheme by the Italian Ministry for Universities and Research (MUR), the center serves as a catalyst for interdisciplinary collaboration, with research goals at the intersection of computer science, particularly artificial intelligence, and the humanities, specifically linguistic and literary studies. DAIH aims to foster and promote inclusion in research, infrastructure, training, and dissemination of scientific content to overcome disparities, inequalities, and discriminations in the modern society.
