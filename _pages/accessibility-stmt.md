The Digital Arena for Inclusive Humanities is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone, and applying the relevant accessibility standards.

## Conformance status

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. To the best of our knowledge, the DAIH website is fully conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA (at least for the aspects that can be verified with automated checks).

## Feedback

We welcome your feedback on the accessibility of the DAIH website. Please let us know if you encounter accessibility barriers on the DAIH website using the contact details available on the [contact](/contact/) page.

## Compatibility with browsers and assistive technology

The DAIH website is designed to be compatible with assistive technologies and the last version of major browsers.

## Technical specifications

The DAIH website relies upon the following technologies for conformance with WCAG 2.1, to improve accessibility and to improve the user experience for everyone:
- HTML
- WAI-ARIA
- CSS

## Assessment approach

DAIH assessed the accessibility of the DAIH website by self-evaluation. For automated checks, the [Silktide Accessibility Checker](https://silktide.com/toolbar/) is used.
