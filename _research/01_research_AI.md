We at DAIH delve into the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies, techniques, and tools, focusing, among others, on their application to Digital Humanities (e.g., {% cite 2021ijdl%}) and particularly those pertaining to languages and literatures. Our primary research streams encompass the development of tools and techniques for:

* Natural language processing and the extraction of high-quality knowledge from textual resources (e.g., {% cite 2023cbm 2021eswa 2020jws %});
* The establishment of robust representations of extracted knowledge and automated reasoning for deriving new insights (e.g., {% cite 2016tkde 2016jws %});
* Developing resources and applications in accordance with Semantic Web and Linked Data best practices (e.g., {% cite 2019lre %});
* Facilitating effective information and document retrieval (e.g., {% cite 2019swj %}).

Furthermore, we explore the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) on diversity, equity, and inclusion, an area of growing importance in contemporary computer science and artificial intelligence research. On one hand, we aim to scrutinize the potential challenges that artificial intelligence techniques may introduce or exacerbate in terms of inclusion. This involves an examination of issues and social biases (such as those pertaining to gender, race, religion, or disabilities) present in computational models trained on huge datasets. Conversely, we seek the development and implementation of concrete tools, methods, technologies, and computational models for automating tasks that foster inclusion and enhance content accessibility.

Moreover, we are also dedicated to analyzing biases towards Artificial Intelligence. For instance, we study the reactions and perceptions of readers towards narratives authored by generative Artificial Intelligence language models. This exploration seeks to comprehend how readers assess such texts in terms of likability, emotional resonance, artistic merit, and inclusivity.
