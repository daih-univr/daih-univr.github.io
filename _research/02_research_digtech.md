We are interested in the application of digital technologies to favour content accessibility, especially of learning materials in the teaching context. In particular, we study:

* proper methodologies to improve the accessibility of digital learning materials (e.g., {% cite 2023moot %});
* methodologies and tools (e.g., screen readers, coding by voice) to improve coding accessibility (e.g., [Python Code Reader](https://github.com/mattia2602/python-code-reader/blob/main/README-EN.md))
