We are interested in the application of digital technologies to favour content accessibility.

In the teaching context, 

* we study and experiment proper methodologies to improve the accessibility of digital learning materials {% cite 2023moot %};
* we develop methodologies and tools (e.g., screen readers, coding by voice) to improve coding accessibility (e.g., [Python Code Reader](https://github.com/mattia2602/python-code-reader/blob/main/README-EN.md));
* we contribute to AI4EDU, an internal project at the University of Verona led by the [Tecnologie Innovative per la Didattica](https://www.univr.it/en/our-services/-/servizi/tecnologie-innovative-per-la-didattica) group (IT and Communications Office), which carried out an exploratory study on the use of AI technologies within the University’s e-learning platform (Moodle).

We are intested in the accessibility of online platforms, like Wikimedia projects or digital storytelling sites. For instance, we examined barriers to participation for people with disabilities on Wikipedia, highlighted key accessibility issues, and promoted collaboration within the Italian-language community to enhance inclusivity in Wikimedia projects {% cite 2025_AccessibilitaWikimedia %}. Moreover, we are conducting an experimental study, inteviewing people by means of an online questionnaire, on the accessibility of a [digital tour of Montorio Veronese](https://izi.travel/it/browse/40ebe3e5-1761-4ecd-b860-4a38c92a5dee), one of the Verona neighbourhoods.

We regularly give lectures and training sessions on assistive technologies and digital document accessibility (e.g., [Tecnologie e strategie per la formazione inclusiva e accessibile](https://www.univr.it/documents/879019/2260871/TECNOLOGIE+E+STRATEGIE+PER+LA+FORMAZIONE+INCLUSIVA+E+ACCESSIBILE_II+semestre+a.a.+24-25.pdf/8ace5c09-6da7-2906-1be5-00a5971ee98d) - University of Verona, [Master’s program in “Glottodidattica inclusiva”](https://www.corsi.univr.it/?ent=cs&id=1213&menu=studiare&tab=insegnamenti&codiceCs=M1P3&codins=4S012916&crediti=2.0&aa=2024/2025&lang=en) - University of Verona, [Accessible Textual Heritage](/events/2026.03.23-04.30_ATH2026/) - University of Verona).
