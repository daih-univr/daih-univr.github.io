We are interested in how the application of computational methods can stimulate new and more inclusive perspectives in literary studies. We are currenlty focusing on two main lines of research:
- how the “distant reading” paradigm helps re-discover the “great unread” {% cite moretti_conjectures_2000 moretti_distant_2013 %}, questioning traditional interpretations of the literary canon;
- how the computational exploration of wide phenomena such as “digital social reading” {% cite rebora_digital_2021 %} helps bridge the gap between professional and non-professional practices in literary criticism {% cite salgaro_literary_2022 %}.
We explore these topics by bringing together the epistemological inquiries of literary theory and the methodological awareness of computer science, letting the two integrate each other.
