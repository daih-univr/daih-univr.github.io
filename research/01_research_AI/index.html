In order to be effectively exploited, metadata information has to meet some quality standards, typically defined in the collection usage guidelines. As manually checking the quality of metadata in a repository may not be affordable, especially in large collections, in this paper we specifically address the problem of automatically assessing the quality of metadata, focusing in particular on textual descriptions of cultural heritage items. We describe a novel approach based on machine learning that tackles this problem by framing it as a binary text classification task aimed at evaluating the accuracy of textual descriptions. We report our assessment of different classifiers using a new dataset that we developed, containing more than 100K descriptions. The dataset was extracted from different collections and domains from the Italian digital library “Cultura Italia”and was annotated with accuracy information in terms of compliance with the cataloguing guidelines. The results empirically confirm that our proposed approach can effectively support curators (F1  0.85) in assessing the quality of the textual descriptions of the records in their collections and provide some insights into how training data, specifically their size and domain, can affect classification performance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="2023cbm" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482522011234" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Machine understanding surgical actions from intervention procedure textbooks</a></div> <div class="author"> Marco Bombieri, Marco Rospocher, Simone Paolo Ponzetto, Paolo Fiorini </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Computers in Biology and Medicine</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The automatic extraction of procedural surgical knowledge from surgery manuals, academic papers or other high-quality textual resources, is of the utmost importance to develop knowledge-based clinical decision support systems, to automatically execute some procedure’s step or to summarize the procedural information, spread throughout the texts, in a structured form usable as a study resource by medical students. In this work, we propose a first benchmark on extracting detailed surgical actions from available intervention procedure textbooks and papers. We frame the problem as a Semantic Role Labeling task. Exploiting a manually annotated dataset, we apply different Transformer-based information extraction methods. Starting from RoBERTa and BioMedRoBERTa pre-trained language models, we first investigate a zero-shot scenario and compare the obtained results with a full fine-tuning setting. We then introduce a new ad-hoc surgical language model, named SurgicBERTa, pre-trained on a large collection of surgical materials, and we compare it with the previous ones. In the assessment, we explore different dataset splits (one in-domain and two out-of-domain) and we investigate also the effectiveness of the approach in a few-shot learning scenario. Performance are evaluated on three correlated sub-tasks: predicate disambiguation, semantic argument disambiguation and predicate-argument disambiguation. Results show that the fine-tuning of a pre-trained domain-specific language model achieves the highest performance on all splits and on all sub-tasks.

We assess the performance of the fastText classifier and word representations with a lyrics dataset of over 800K songs, annotated with explicit information, that we assembled from publicly available resources. The evaluation shows that the fastText classifier is effective for explicit lyrics detection, substantially outperforming a reference approach for the task, and that the subword information effectively contributes to this result.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="2020jws" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title"><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826820300500" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Knowledge-driven joint posterior revision of named entity classification and linking</a></div> <div class="author"> Marco Rospocher, Francesco Corcoglioniti </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Web Semantics</em>, 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In this work we address the problem of extracting quality entity knowledge from natural language text, an important task for the automatic construction of knowledge graphs from unstructured content. More in details, we investigate the benefit of performing a joint posterior revision, driven by ontological background knowledge, of the annotations resulting from natural language processing (NLP) entity analyses such as named entity recognition and classification (NERC) and entity linking (EL). The revision is performed via a probabilistic model, called jpark, that given the candidate annotations independently identified by NERC and EL tools on the same textual entity mention, reconsiders the best annotation choice performed by the tools in light of the coherence of the candidate annotations with the ontological knowledge. The model can be explicitly instructed to handle the information that an entity can potentially be NIL (i.e., lacking a corresponding referent in the target linking knowledge base), exploiting it for predicting the best NERC and EL annotation combination. We present a comprehensive evaluation of jpark along various dimensions, comparing its performances with and without exploiting NIL information, as well as the usage of three different background knowledge resources (YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata) to build the model. The evaluation, conducted using different tools (the popular Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight, as well as the more recent Flair NER and End-to-End Neural EL) with three reference datasets (AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP), empirically confirms the capability of the model to improve the quality of the annotations of the given tools, and thus their performances on the tasks they are designed for.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="2016tkde" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title"><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7549111/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Frame-Based Ontology Population with PIKES</a></div> <div class="author"> Francesco Corcoglioniti, Marco Rospocher, Alessio Palmero Aprosio </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</em>, 2016 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We present an approach for ontology population from natural language English texts that extracts RDF triples according to FrameBase, a Semantic Web ontology derived from FrameNet.

Our findings reveal that LLMs often produce homogenized personas that underrepresent demographic diversity and that conditioning on attributes such as gender, ethnicity, or disability may trigger stereotypical shifts.
